                <h2>What I'm Interested In</h2>
                <p>I am a jack of all trades, master of none. Many things I enjoy doing, time I lack. I bet you want to know what I spend my <i>minimal</i> freetime doing. Okay, I'll tell you.</p>
                <p>One of the hobbies I have recently picked up is messing around in a home lab I created. I am a Cybersecurity student so it's useful to me to have a homelab that allows me to mess around with network configurations, protocols, figure out how different network services work, how to break them, how to exploit them, etc. It has been a lot of fun and I've spent a lot of time working on it. I recently built a home server to replace proprietary services like media streaming, office suites, password managers, etc. with my own self-hosted equivalents.</p>
                <p>I love to workout with my wife. We do some sort of workout every day whether it be going to the gym or going on runs. We love being active outside especially in warm weather. Praise God for this planet!</p>
